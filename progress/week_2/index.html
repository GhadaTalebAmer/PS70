    <h3> Introduction to 2D Design </h3>
    <p> This week, I tried to learn different procedures in Inkscape. The following details some of the new skills I learned with examples of work produced. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol >
        <li> <h4> <b> Converting a bitmap picture into a vector format </b></h4></li>  
      <p> I began by trying the example on the site. I followed the steps to trace the bitmap of the paddle sketch picture into a vector. I played around with the features in the dialog box to see how the picture would change. I changed the line color to red as shown below. </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="container text-center"> 
      <h4> <i> Paddle Bitmap Picture to Vector </i></h4>
      <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./sample.png" style="width:30%" alt="Paddle Sketch"></p>
    </div>

       <div class="container text">
    <p> I then tried coverting some other pictures from google into vector formats. I first converted them to bitmaps and then repeated the above steps to trace the outlines of each picture and create vectors. Below are pictures of the bitmaps and the corresponding vectors. </p>
      <br>
       <div class="container text-center"> 
      <h4> <i> Flower Pictures to Vector Formats </i></h4>
      <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./test_bitmap_vector.png" style="width:40%" alt="Flower Bitmaps"></p>
    </div>

      <h3> Using a Multimeter </h3>
      <p> This was the first time I had used a multimeter before. It was interesting to see how voltages changed across different components. I decided to open up the breadboard to see what it looked like on the inside. I enjoyed familiarizing myself with the basics of electronics so that I can later build more complex circuits.   </p>

       <h3> Next Steps </h3>   
       <ol> 
        <li> Continue working on site and fix page layout </li>
        <li> Make sure all page links work on nav bar </li>
        <li> Fix Arduino download errors </li>
        <li> Try making Blink program work </li>
        <li> Build more complex circuits </li>
