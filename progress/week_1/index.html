    <h3> Introduction to HTML </h3>
    <p> Since I have always wanted to learn web design, I focused on learning the basics of html. It took a lot of trial and error for me to get the hang of it. I took the website template and tried to use it as a guide to personalize my own site. I enjoyed using in-line css to change the style and layout of each page. The hardest part was linking all the pages using a navigation feature. For next week, I want to focus on fixing the nav bar I added and making sure that all the links work. </p>

      <h3> Building a Simple Circuit </h3>
      <p> For this week, we were tasked with building a simple circuit. I found this exciting because I have not made a circle since my middle school physics class. I quickly found that I needed a refresher on how circuits work, their components and how to put them together. So, this week, I focused on re-learning these basics and just making sure that I put together all the basic components needed to light up an LED. The Below is a picture of my completed circuit. The main issue I faced was that the LED wasn't lighting up even though I put together all the components in the right way. I realized after playing around a bit that it was a matter of the power source not being plugged in correctly. </p>

      <h3> Using a Multimeter </h3>
      <p> This was the first time I had used a multimeter before. It was interesting to see how voltages changed across different components. I decided to open up the breadboard to see what it looked like on the inside. </p>

      <h3> Design </h3>
      <p>  Although the cardboard cutout was effective at engaging the community in sharing their own stories, it is a largely unsustainable tool for organizations that want to engage in such co-creation on a larger scale. By adding extra features as the following, a new tool can be used as a single, all-inclusive solution to engaging communities in participatory design. </p>
