    <h3> The Assignment </h3>
    <p> This week's assignment was to program an Arduino board to do something.    </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Initial Problems </h3>
      <p> This week, I began by encountering various problems. I had issues with installing the Adafruit packages and could not upload anything to my board. After trying out many fixes and not succeeding, I decided to switch from the Itsy Bitsy to using the Arduino Uno board. I had to download extra drivers to communicate with the board and ultimately resolved my problem.   </p>
      <br>
        <h3> First Attempts at Programmming the Arduino Uno </h3>
      <p> Since I've never used a microcontroller before, I tried same basic programming projects for beginners. I outline each of these projects in what follows. </p>
      <br>
      
       <h4> <i> Project 1: Blink an LED</i></h4> 
      <p> Since I faced issues with downloading the hardware, I decided to retry the assignment from the first weeek of class that involves making an LED blink. To do this, I completed the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li> I built a simple circuit by inserting a jumper into GND  pin on the Arduino and then in the GND rail of the breadboard. I then inserted another jumper wire into pin 13 on  the Arduino and then the other end in the breadboard. </li>
          <li> I placed both the red LED and a 220 Ohm resistor into the breadboard. I placed the long leg of the LED into ground. </li> 
          <li> I then connected the Arduino Uno to my computer via the USB cable. I found the blink sketch in examples section and uploaded it to my board. </li>
          <li> The program successfully executed. The red LED on the breadboard turns on for a second and then off for a second and continues in a loop. See gif below. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        <h4> <i> Project 2: Changing Blink sketch code</i></h4> 
      <p> After making the LED blink, I decided to start playing around with the code to change the blinking speed. To do this, I did the following:
        <ol>
          <li> I changed the delay portion of the sketch to 200. This made the LED blink much faster than before. Code as follows: 
          void loop() {
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
          delay(200);                       
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
          delay(200);} </li> 
          <li> I then tried to make the LED blink for longer with a shorter stop time in between. To do this, I changed the first delay to (200) and the second to a (1000). This gave me a long red blink followed by a short stop flash. Code as follows: 
          void loop() {
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
          delay(200);                       
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
          delay(1000);} </li> 
          <li> The program successfully executed. The red LED on the breadboard turns on for a second and then off for a second and continues in a loop. See gif beblow. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      </div>
 <h4> <i> Project 3: Blink LED with a switch</i></h4> 
      <p> I decided to use a small pushbutton switch to control an LED. To do this, I created a new circuit with the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li> I connected a jumper wire from GND to the breadboard near A13. I then added another jumper wire from this GND rail to H19. I connected another wire from the power on the breadboard to around H26. </li>
           <li> I connected another jumper wire from pin 2 to around J24. I placed a 10k ohm resistor too between G19 and G23. I then placed the pushbutton switch into F23 and a 220 ohm resistor. </li>
            <li> I instered the short leg of the blue LED in the GND rail and the long leg around B5. </li>
             <li> I connected a wire from pin 13 to I5 on the breadboard and another wire from %v to the power rail near A8.
             I connected the Arduino Uno to my computer and uploaded a sketch to switch the button. The sketch is from the examples folder: file > examples > digital > button. </li>
             <li>
              Gif below shows me pressing the pushbutton. Upon pressing it, the circuit breaks and the LED remains off until I let go. </li>

              <li> Code as follows:
// 
const int buttonPin = 2;     
const int ledPin =  13;      /

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}
void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}</li> 
   </ol>
