    <h3> The Assignment </h3>
    <p> This week's assignment was to program an Arduino board to do something.    </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Initial Problems </h3>
      <p> This week, I began by encountering various problems. I had issues with installing the Adafruit packages and could not upload anything to my board. After trying out many fixes and not succeeding, I decided to switch from the Itsy Bitsy to using the Arduino Uno board. I had to download extra drivers to communicate with the board and ultimately resolved my problem.   </p>
      <br>
        <h3> First Attempts at Programmming the Arduino Uno </h3>
      <p> Since I've never used a microcontroller before, I tried same basic programming projects for beginners. I outline each of these projects in what follows. </p>
      <br>
      
       <h4> <i> Project 1: Blink an LED</i></h4> 
      <p> Since I faced issues with downloading the hardware, I decided to retry the assignment from the first weeek of class that involves making an LED blink. To do this, I completed the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li> I built a simple circuit by inserting a jumper into GND  pin on the Arduino and then in the GND rail of the breadboard. I then inserted another jumper wire into pin 13 on  the Arduino and then the other end in the breadboard. </li>
          <li> I placed both the red LED and a 220 Ohm resistor into the breadboard. I placed the long leg of the LED into ground. </li> 
          <li> I then connected the Arduino Uno to my computer via the USB cable. I found the blink sketch in examples section and uploaded it to my board. </li>
          <li> The program successfully executed. The red LED on the breadboard turns on for a second and then off for a second and continues in a loop. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        <h4> <i> Project 2: Making an LED blink faster</i></h4> 
      <p> After making the LED blink, I decided to start playing around with the code to change the blinking speed. To do this, I did the following:
        <ol>
          <li> I changed the delay portion of the sketch to 200. This made the LED blink much faster than before. </li> 
          <li> I then tried to make the LED blink for longer with a shorter stop time in between. To do this, I changed the first delay to (2000) and the second to a (100). This gave me a long red blink followed by a short stop flash.  </li>
          <li> The program successfully executed. The red LED on the breadboard turns on for a second and then off for a second and continues in a loop. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
