    <h3> The Assignment </h3>
    <p> This week's assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture composed of pieces cut from at least two different materials. Other requirements include: at least one static joint, at least one prismatic or revolute joint, and (optional) circuitry to move the sculpture. I decided to take on this assignment as a way to showcase what I learned about using different hand tools and mechanics this week. Given that I am coming into this class with very litle background knowledge on digital and physical fabrication, this week was exciting as it gave me a chance to learn a wide range of techniques.   </p>
      <br>
      <h3> The Initial Design </h3>
      <p> I began by researching examples of kinetic scultpures and the processes used to make them move. I then began brainstorming ideas of sculptures that would have some practical purpose in my life. I settled on designing a sculpture I could give to our neighbor who has young children my roommates and I often babysit for. We used to make sock puppets with them and they were always very excited to make them. I decided to take this one step further and make a mechanical puppet I could gift them. Because I was designing this with children in mind, I wanted to include simple mechanics. Thus, as included below, I designed a basic mechanical puppet with a DC motor attached.   </p>
      <br>
        <h4> <i> Initial Sketch </i></h4>
      <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./sketch.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="Sketch"></p>
      <p> My design consists of two main components: the wall mount with the mechanical system and the puppet itself. Below I outline the steps followed to create each part.</p>

      <h3> Creating the Motorized Disk and Wall Mount </h3>
      <p> I began by measuring and cutting out a block of wood that would hold the motor and the puppet. The dimensions I used were 11cm in height and 16cm in width. I then created a point at the center marking where I would need to drill a hole for the motor (6mm). I used a table saw to cut out my block of wood. I then measured the diameter of the motor's shaft and found a drill bit of the same size. I used a hand drill to drill the hole in the middle. I then used a file to smooth the edges of the hole and create rounded edges for the wooden block.

      <br>
      <p> Next, I used the laser cutter to cut out two disks of diameters 6 and 3cm. I then used the hand drill to drill holes of 6mm in each (same size as motor shaft). See below.

      <br>
      I then began creating the motor. For this, I first had to de-solder the brushes of the motor to remove the wires that were previously attached. I used de-soldering braid for this. Then, I soldered on a red and black wire on either brush. I tested it out by connecting to a power supply and it worked. I then pushed the shaft of the motor into the hole in my wooden block. It was tight enough to hold it without additional glue. I then attached both disks on the end of the shaft. I made sure that the motor only spun the disks and not the wooden base by using a file to slightly enlarge the hole in the wooden block. See below image of motor with disks attached.

      <br>

      <h3> Creating the Puppet </h3>
      <p>  I then moved on to the next part of my sculpture: the puppet. I collected a few used pieces of wood that I found around the shop. These included wooden balls of different sizes, cylinders and blocks. I wanted to make my puppet out of recycled pieces because I was going to paint over it. See below.  </p>
        
         <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./pieces.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="Motor"></p>

      <p> I began by drilling a hole in the largest sphere (which would be the head of the puppet) through which I could attach a rod that would be connected to the top wooden block. I did this by securing the sphere in a clamp and using a hand drill with a drill bit equal to the diameter of the rod. </p>
