    <h3> The Assignment </h3>
    <p> This week's assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture composed of pieces cut from at least two different materials. Other requirements include: at least one static joint, at least one prismatic or revolute joint, and (optional) circuitry to move the sculpture. I decided to take on this assignment as a way to showcase what I learned about using different hand tools and mechanics this week. Given that I am coming into this class with very litle background knowledge on digital and physical fabrication, this week was exciting as it gave me a chance to learn a wide range of techniques.   </p>
      <br>
      <h3> The Initial Design </h3>
      <p> I began by researching examples of kinetic scultpures and the processes used to make them move. I then began brainstorming ideas of sculptures that would have some practical purpose in my life. I settled on designing a sculpture I could give to our neighbor who has young children my roommates and I often babysit for. We used to make sock puppets with them and they were always very excited to make them. I decided to take this one step further and make a mechanical puppet I could gift them. Because I was designing this with children in mind, I wanted to include simple mechanics. Thus, as included below, I designed a basic mechanical puppet with a DC motor attached.   </p>

      <p> My design consists of two main components: the wall mount with the mechanical system and the puppet itself. Below I outline the steps followed to create each part.</p>

      <h3> Creating the Motorized Disk and Wall Mount </h3>
      <p> I began by measuring and cutting out a block of wood that would hold the motor and the puppet. The dimensions I used were 11cm in height and 16cm in width. I then created a point at the center marking where I would need to drill a hole for the motor. I used a table saw to cut out my block of wood. I then measured the diameter of the motor's shaft and found a drill bit of the same size. I used a hand drill to drill the hole in the middle. I then used a file to smooth the edges of the hole and create rounded edges for the wooden block.
