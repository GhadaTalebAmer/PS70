      <p> Summary of Week 2 </p>

    <h3> Introduction to 2D Design </h3>
    <p> This week, I tried to learn different procedures in Inkscape. The following details some of the new skills I learned with examples of work produced. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
       <h4> <b> Converting a bitmap picture into a vector format </b></h4>
      <p> I began by trying the example on the site. I followed the steps to trace the bitmap of the paddle sketch picture into a vector. I played around with the features in the dialog box to see how the picture would change. I changed the line color to red as shown below. </p>
      
    </div>
<div class="container text">   
       <h5> Steps followed: </h5>   
       <ol> 
        <li> Import bitmap of paddle sketch into Inkspace sheet </li>
        <li> Traced bitmap with edge detection </li>
        <li> Deleted the bitmap, left me with vectors (looks like outline of the image) </li>
        <li> Change style with fill = no colour and stroke = red </li>
        <li> Broke apart the paths and removed the extra lines by deleting them </li>
        <li> Kept simplifying the path until smooth </li>
        <li> Exported the image as a png to add to my website </li>

    </div>

       <div class="container text">
    <p> I then tried coverting some other pictures from google into vector formats. I first converted them to bitmaps and then repeated the above steps to trace the outlines of each picture and create vectors. Below are pictures of the bitmaps and the corresponding vectors. </p>

    </div>
      <br>
        <h4> <b> Using GIMP for processing a photograph for vinyl cutting </b></h4>
      <p> I imported an image of my friend and I into GIMP. Under color menu, I chose threshold option. Adjusted it to get the color I wanted. I applied the blur Gaussian filter. Then, I applied threshold again to make the borders sharper and get the level of detail I wanted. I ended up with a black-and-white png for vinyl-cutting.</p>

       <h3> Next Steps </h3>   
       <ol> 
        <li> Continue working on site and fix page layout </li>
        <li> Make sure all page links work on nav bar </li>
        <li> Fix Arduino download errors </li>
        <li> Try making Blink program work </li>
        <li> Build more complex circuits </li>

  <h3>Assignment 3: Making a Kinetic Sculpture </h3> 
  <br>     
      <p> Mechanical Puppet </p>

      <br>
        <div class="container text">

    <h3> The Assignment </h3>
    <p> This week's assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture composed of pieces cut from at least two different materials. Other requirements include: at least one static joint, at least one prismatic or revolute joint, and (optional) circuitry to move the sculpture. I decided to take on this assignment as a way to showcase what I learned about using different hand tools and mechanics this week. Given that I am coming into this class with very litle background knowledge on digital and physical fabrication, this week was exciting as it gave me a chance to learn a wide range of techniques.   </p>
      <br>
      <h3> The Initial Design </h3>
      <p> I began by researching examples of kinetic scultpures and the processes used to make them move. I then began brainstorming ideas of sculptures that would have some practical purpose in my life. I settled on designing a sculpture I could give to our neighbor who has young children my roommates and I often babysit for. We used to make sock puppets with them and they were always very excited to make them. I decided to take this one step further and make a mechanical puppet I could gift them. Because I was designing this with children in mind, I wanted to include simple mechanics. Thus, as included below, I designed a basic mechanical puppet with a DC motor attached.   </p>
      <br>
      <div class="container text-center"> 
        <h4> <i> Initial Sketch </i></h4>
      <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./sketch.jpg" style="width:50%" alt="Sketch"></p>
    </div>
      <p> My design consists of two main components: the wall mount with the mechanical system and the puppet itself. Below I outline the steps followed to create each part.</p>

      <h3> Creating the Motorized Disk and Wall Mount </h3>
      <p> I began by measuring and cutting out a block of wood that would hold the motor and the puppet. The dimensions I used were 11cm in height and 16cm in width. I then created a point at the center marking where I would need to drill a hole for the motor (6mm). I used a table saw to cut out my block of wood. I then measured the diameter of the motor's shaft and found a drill bit of the same size. I used a hand drill to drill the hole in the middle. I then used a file to smooth the edges of the hole and create rounded edges for the wooden block. 
      </p>
      <div class="container text-center"> 
       <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./block.jpg" style="width:40%" alt="Block">
      </div>
      <br>
      <p> Next, I used the laser cutter to cut out two disks of diameters 6 and 3cm. I then used the hand drill to drill holes of 6mm in each (same size as motor shaft). See below.  
<div class="container text-center"> 
        <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./discs.jpg" style="width:40%" alt="Disk"></p>
        </div>
      <br>
      I then began creating the motor. For this, I first had to de-solder the brushes of the motor to remove the wires that were previously attached. I used de-soldering braid for this. Then, I soldered on a red and black wire on either brush. I tested it out by connecting to a power supply and it worked. I then pushed the shaft of the motor into the hole in my wooden block. It was tight enough to hold it without additional glue. I then attached both disks on the end of the shaft. I made sure that the motor only spun the disks and not the wooden base by using a file to slightly enlarge the hole in the wooden block. See below image of motor with disks attached. 
<div class="container text-center"> 
      <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./motor.jpg" style="width:40%" alt="Motor"></p>
      <br>
    </div>

      <h3> Creating the Puppet </h3>
      <p>  I then moved on to the next part of my sculpture: the puppet. I collected a few used pieces of wood that I found around the shop. These included wooden balls of different sizes, cylinders and blocks. I wanted to make my puppet out of recycled pieces because I was going to paint over it. See below.  </p>
        <div class="container text-center"> 
         <p> <style="text-align:center;"><img src="./pieces.jpg" style="width:40%" alt="Motor"></p>
       </div>

      <p> I began by drilling a hole in the largest sphere (which would be the head of the puppet) through which I could attach a rod that would be connected to the top wooden block. I did this by securing the sphere in a clamp and using a hand drill with a drill bit equal to the diameter of the rod. </p>
