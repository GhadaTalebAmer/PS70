    <h3> Motivation </h3>
    <p> For the past two years, I have been a researcher at MIT's D-Lab. As part of my research, I spent two months with an indigenous Mayan community in Santa Catarina, Guatemala working with a team stationed there. Our team was tasked with trying to engage the community in participatory design. We realized that the community had been subjected to numerous failed developmental efforts that did not engage them at any stage of the design process. Instead, the community was given solutions that outside designers thought they needed. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> The Problem </h3>
      <p> Prior to our arrival in Guatemala, the community was given a large amount of bicycles by foreign aid organizations. These organizations thought that these bicycles would solve the issues the community members faced (e.g. better transportation to other villages, greater job opportunities outside, access to more resources). However, upon our arrival, we realized that brand new bicycles were left unused in piles around the community. We wanted to engage the community that was left disenchanted by previous development efforts in a new design process to jointly create the solutions they actually needed. However, because all previous efforts were largely deemed a failure, community members were hesitant to engage in a new design process. We had to figure out how to help the community participate in designing for themselves. 
      <br>
      <h3> Initial Solution </h3>
      <p> Our initial solution to gaining community participation was a cardboard storytelling cube. The cube was designed by Link4 - a local startup working with us on the ground. Each face of the cube was engraved with a small icon; e.g. a smiley or sad face. Each participant received their own cube and had to decorate it. Then, all participants went around and shared their individual stories with the help of the cube.

      <h3> Design </h3>
      <p>  Although the cardboard cutout was effective at engaging the community in sharing their own stories, it is a largely unsustainable tool for organizations that want to engage in such co-creation on a larger scale. By adding extra features as the following, a new tool can be used as a single, all-inclusive solution to engaging communities in participatory design.
