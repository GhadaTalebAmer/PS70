    <h3> Motivation </h3>
    <p> For the past two years, I have been a researcher at MIT's D-Lab. As part of my research, I spent two months with an indigenous Mayan community in Santa Catarina, Guatemala working with a team stationed there. Our team was tasked with trying to engage the community in participatory design. We realized that the community had been subjected to numerous failed developmental efforts that did not engage them at any stage of the design process. Instead, the community was given solutions that outside designers thought they needed. </p>
