      <p> Hi! My name is Ghada Amer. I was born and raised in Jordan. I am a Senior in Dudley House currently completing my Concentration in Government with a Secondary in WGS. I have previously worked on participatory design efforts in Guatemala and I am excited to continue building upon what I have learned in order to design for development. I am particularly interested in fabricating innovative digital solutions to community problems through this course!  </p>
